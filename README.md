## Building

If your project requires additional steps to build or configure the environment after code changes, you can use the provided `build.sh` script.

1. Make the script executable (if it's not already):

    ```bash
    chmod +x build.sh
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```

### What happens here:
- `chmod +x build.sh` makes the script executable if it wasn't already.
- `./build.sh` runs the script, which automatically executes the necessary commands to set up the environment, apply migrations, collect static files, etc.

This script may include steps like applying migrations, installing dependencies, setting up environment variables, or any other project-specific configuration tasks.

    ```
